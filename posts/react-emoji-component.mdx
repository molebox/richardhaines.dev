Im working on a project where I use a lot of emoji (because I love them! 😍), so I decided to create an Emoji component, because you know, it's the right thing to do. I had it setup pretty good I thought, was passing in an aria-label, set the role to img and wrapped it in a span. But the linter was complaining that my emoji wasn't wrapped in a span and that it had to have a role of img and a aria-label. What was going on????

Turns out i didn't take into account how I was rendering the emoji. Lets look at how my first attempt looked.

``` jsx
import React from 'react';

const Emoji = ({ children, ariaLabel }) => (
  <span role="img" aria-label={ariaLabel}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

export default Emoji;

// usage
<Emoji ariaLabel="Two hands shaking">🤝🏽</Emoji>
```

Pretty straight forward, im passing in my emoji as a child so that its wrapped in the span. Im also setting the role to img and also passing in the aria-label. But this doesn't pass the linters accessibility tests. 

``` jsx
import React from 'react';

const Emoji = ({ariaLabel, symbol}) => (
  <span role="img" aria-label={ariaLabel}>
      {symbol}
  </span>
);
export default Emoji;

// usage
<Emoji ariaLabel="Two hands shaking" symbol="🤝🏽"/>
```

By passing the emoji as an explicit string prop out linter is now content and we can go about our business adding an obscene amount of emoji to our site! 😄
