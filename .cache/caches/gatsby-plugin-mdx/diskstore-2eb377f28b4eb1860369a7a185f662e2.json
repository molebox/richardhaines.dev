While Gatsby is a progressive web app generator where you can connect to any backend headless CMS you like, Redwood aims to take the full stack approach and gives you an api setup via prisma. The main difference could be argued to be their approaches to data and how you store and retrieve it. With Gatsby you get the database connection at build time where as with Redwood its at runtime.

The ease from which you can start creating your routes, components and pages is a delight to work with. There are some best practices borrowed from Rails (which i have never looked at) and these scaffolded implementation take advantage of them, but you are not tied to them. I have to say that i found it a breath of fresh air to have a CLI that gave me what i (thought) i wanted. An interesting case in point is the concept of Cells. When we load data into a component or page we have to take into consideration a couple of factors before we can show said data to the user.`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Is the data loading?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Has it loaded successfully?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Was there an error?`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`These are all standard things we check for. Now, this may be a popular pattern that other developers adopt in their projects but it was new to me. With the idea of Cells Redwood wants you to take a declarative approach to fetching the data by having one file related to the data being fetched that exports a few named constants:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Loading`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Empty`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Failure`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Success`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Within your Loading function you can export any kind of loading logic you would like to be shown before the data has been fetched. Empty? You guessed it, the data is empty. And Success is where you actually show the loaded data.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An example of how this might look, borrowing from the Redwood tutorial:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-js\"\n      }}>{`export const QUERY = gql\\`\n  query {\n    posts {\n      id\n      title\n      body\n      createdAt\n    }\n  }\n\\`;\n\n// We can show anything we like here, maybe a cool animation?\nexport const Loading = () => <div>Loading...</div>;\n\n// Don't just show an empty page or section, get creative and show a dancing banana!\nexport const Empty = () => <div>No posts yet!</div>;\n\n// The posts failed to load, lets show the error message\nexport const Failure = ({ error }) => (\n  <div>Error loading posts: {error.message}</div>\n);\n\n// The data to show in whatever format you like\nexport const Success = ({ posts }) => {\n  return posts.map(post => (\n    <article>\n      <h2>{post.title}</h2>\n      <div>{post.body}</div>\n    </article>\n  ));\n};\n`}</code></pre>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"scaffolding\"\n    }}>{`Scaffolding`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The magic happens behind the scenes but the gist is that it will show the Loading component first then once the query is run Redwood will show one of the three other states. These functions are placed in a file appended with Cell.
