## The basics

I'm trying to up my css and animation game, this is a record of my notes taken while looking into [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/). I'll constantly be adding to it as I go. The main purpose of this record is a reference for me to use while updating my site using GSAP (gsap)

--------------------------

The gsap object has three helpful methods for creating tweens and optionally adding them to timelines. A timeline is a container for multiple tweens. Each tweens is called a child of the timeline.

- gsap.to()
- gsap.from()
- gsap.fromTo()

For best performance animate CSS transforms and opacities.
- x and y
- rotation, rotationX, rotationY
- scaleX, scaleY, scale
- skewX, skewY

Though gsap can animate any numeric property. So not display for example.
- width, height
- top, left (position must be set to relative, fixed or absolute)
- borderRadius
- colors
- viewport values

## gsap.to()

``` js
// The fist param is the target to animate. This could be a className, which would specifically target any element with that className applied.
gsap.to(".target");

// Or an actual HTML tag which would select all of them on the page. I guess a ref could be used in React
gsap.to("img");

// This will move the target element 500 pixels along the x axis for a duration of 3 seconds (the default duration is 500ms, if not set)
// The fist param is the target to animate
// The second is the vars object that contains the properties to animate
gsap.to(".target", {x: 500, duration: 3});

// A tween can change multiple properties over a period of time
// The target will move across the x axis for a duration of 3 seconds while scaling up 3 times its size, rotating a full 360 degrees and changing its colour to tomato
gsap.to(".target", {x: 500, scale: 3, rotation: 360, fill:"tomato", duration: 3});

// A tween can change multiple properties of multiple elements too. If multiple elements have the className .target then all three would move the same as declared above
// If the stagger property is added, as below, then each of the elements animations would fire off with a 1 second delay between them
gsap.to(".target", {stagger: 1, x: 500, scale: 3, rotation: 360, fill:"tomato", duration: 3});

```

## gsap.from() and gsap.fromTo()

``` js

// The from tween will do the reverse of the to tween, so the target will start at x: 500 and have a scale of 3 but will spin 360 and shrink while returning to the original position on the page taking a duration of 3 seconds
gsap.from(".target", {x: 500, scale: 3, rotation: 360, duration: 3});

// The fromTo tween lets you set the start and end values
// The first vars object is the from values and the second is the to values
// The properties in the var objects from and to don't have to match up
gsap.fromTo(".target", {x: 100, y: 250}, {x: 200, y: 300, scale: 3, duration: 2})

// If you set the opacity to 0 on the from and don't set it to 1 in the to then it wont appear as it doesn't know that you want to animate it to opacity 1
gsap.fromTo(".target", {x: 100, y: 250, opacity: 0}, {x: 200, y: 300, scale: 3, duration: 2})

```

## repeat and delay

``` js

// The repeat and delay properties can be added. They are pretty self explanatory.
// Repeat will run the animation for the given number of times, delay will delay the animation for the given number of seconds
gsap.to(".target", {x: 500, duration: 3, repeat: 2});
gsap.to(".target", {x: 500, duration: 3, delay: 2});

// You can add the boolean yoyo with a repeat to make the animation repeat the given number of times in a yoyo motion. 
// So it wont just snap back like if using just repeat
gsap.to(".target", {x: 500, duration: 3, repeat: 2, yoyo: true});

// To repeat infinitely use -1 as the repeat value
gsap.to(".target", {x: 500, duration: 3, repeat: -1, yoyo: true});

```

## easing

The default setting for ease is easeOut. See [GSAP Easing](https://greensock.com/docs/v2/Easing) for examples of them all. On that page there is a graph whihc shows how the animations run. The steeper the curve, the faster the animation, or movement. The flatter the curve, the slower the animation or movement.

Ease types: 
- in
- inOut
- out

** You don't have to specify out as it's implied seeing as it's the default **

These can be combined with: 
- power0
- power1
- power2
- power3
- power4
- back
- elastic
- bounce
- rough
- slowMo
- stepped
- circ
- expo
- sine

``` js

// If you add ease linear then it removes the easing
gsap.to(".target", {x: 200, ease: "linear"});

// There 3 types of ease that can be combined via dot notation with different types of animation, causing different effects
// For example
gsap.to(".target", {x: 300, duration: 3, ease:"bounce.inOut"})

// Back will overshoot the end point and bounce back slightly. Back takes a function param which specifies how much it will overshoot the end point and bounce back again
gsap.to(".target", {x: 300, duration: 3, ease:"back(3)"})


```

## stagger

Used to stagger a group of elements animations.

``` js
// If you have a number of elements with the className .target then this will stagger the animations 1 second apart
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: 1});

// For a really subtle stagger you can lower the stagger amount
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: 0.2});

// Stagger can take an object instead of just a numerical value. Inside this object you can pass some params
// Passing each with a numerical value will work the same as just passing a numerical value to stagger. 
// So in this example each element will fire after 0.2 second, the same as the above implementation
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: {
    each: 0.2
}});

// You can also pass amount as a param, which will make each element in the group share the numerical value.
// If we had 5 elements in our group, each animation would fire for a total of 1 second, so the gap in between would be shorter 
// but the whole groups animation would take 1 second
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: {
    amount: 1
}});

// From can be used to tell gsap from where to begin the stagger. You can pass the array position
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: {
    from: 2
}});

// Or you can pass some string values. (Random was added in v3.1.0)
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: {
    from: "start" || "center" || "edges" || "end" || "random"
}});

// This looks cool, if your elements are visually in a grid on the page you can pass grid as a param, indicating how many rows and columns there are. 
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: {
    grid: [3,4] // 3 rows, 4 columns
}});

// Or you can pass auto to grid and gsap will calculate the rows and columns using element.getBoundingClientRect()
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: {
    grid: "auto"
}});

// If you have a grid you can focus on just one axis (x or y)
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: {
    grid: "auto",
    from: "center",
    axis: "y"
}});

// A cool example from the gsap website. If you have a grid of boxes then you can make them fall away from the center
gsap.to(".box", {
  duration: 1,
  scale: 0.1,
  y: 40,
  ease: "power1.inOut",

  stagger: {
    grid: [7,15],
    from: "center",
    amount: 1.5
  }
});

// And of course you can add an ease (if you don't the default is out remember) that distributes the start times of the animations
gsap.to(".target", {x: 350, stagger: {
    grid: "auto",
    from: "center",
    axis: "y",
    ease: "power2.in"
}});
```
